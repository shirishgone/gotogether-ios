@class MMRecord;

/* This class represents a record in its prototype state before it hatches into a full living breathing
   MMRecord.  Proto records are typically created to match the contents of a request's response object.
   If your response object contains an array of 20 records of type "user", then you would create 20
   proto records for the user entity.  A proto record contains the entity whose type it represents and the
   dictionary it is based on from the response object.  It is also responsible for maintaining the
   association between itself and other proto records that represent the relationships to it's fully
   formed record.  One subtle thing to keep in mind is that only one proto record should be created for
   each unique record in the response object.  The proto record is not responsible for that, but it is
   an important consideration for a user of this class to consider.  This class is responsible for 
   populating records with their given dictionary, as well as establishing relationships to it's record.
